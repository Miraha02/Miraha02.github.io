We decided to create a fishing-themed clicker game. This project helped us consider the advantages and drawbacks of mobile gaming. Through this project, I learned how to use the phone's accelerometer in Unity to detect when the phone is shaken. I also learned how to make the phone vibrate when the user fails at fishing.",

      "description": "Continuation of the AI navigation project. Using a previously created library, I developed a game where the player must work with AI to retrieve injured people from the road and bring them to the hospital. The map is randomly generated (except for the map borders) with a coherent path and the hospital at the center. Furthermore, we were prohibited from having the AIs communicate with each other. This project helped me improve my understanding of AI in video games while working around these constraints.",
